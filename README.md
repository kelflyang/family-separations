# Family Separations Under the Zero Tolerance Policy

## Project URL: https://sophzheng.github.io/11.154-family-separations/

A journalistic web page documenting the family separations that occurred at the US-Mexican border under Trumpâ€™s Zero Tolerance immigration policy. Made by analyzing a data set retrieved by the American Immigration Council through the Freedom of Information Act and with three other students (Sophia Zhang, Lucas Drexler-Bruce, and Enrique Casillas) for a final project. The main data visualizations include an interactive map and animated arc diagrams made using D3 and MapBox. The original repository is private so this is a copy.
